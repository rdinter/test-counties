# Things That Still Puzzle

A quick sketch of things I am struggling with at the moment to comprehend. This may be refined or ignored in the future:

1. **Panel Data:** econometrics lingo of fixed versus random effects.
    - Implementation in packages "plm", "nlme", and others
    - look at the guts of estimating Random Effects

2. **Poisson**
    1. Interpretation of coefficients?
    2. What is the GLS solution?
    3. Difference with Negative Binomial?
    **fit variogram in geoR** ... then fix in `corSpatial`
        - Different variogram for each year?

3. **Zero-Inflated:** ... is this like two-staged? And further, why not report coefficient with P(X=0).

4. **Variogram:** look into spatio-temporal.
    1. How is this related with time?
    2. Check for isotropy?
    3. Does the "bin" matter? This is just for visualization, right?

5. **Bayesian:** shouldn't I be able to see the relationship with maximum likelihood methods? There *must* be a link between the two.
